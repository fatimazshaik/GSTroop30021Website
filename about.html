They decided to form a Girl Scout Troop. Little did they know that they would <strong>forever impact</strong> each and every girl in their troop.The troop started off with small activities. Product sales, helping locals at the community homeless shelter, learning sewwing and knitting skills. These activities not only helped the girls bond with each other but caused them to <strong>want more.</strong> They dreamed of making the world  a better place, they dreamed of ending world hunger and most importantly they dreamed they were <strong>unstoppable</strong>.

											<h3>Registration</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Our troop has three divisions: juniors, cadettes, and seniors. Based on the girl's grade level in school and their age, they will be placed in these three sectors. Juniors are girls who are currently in 3rd to 5th grade. Cadettes are girls who are in 6th to 8th grade. Seniors are girls who are either in 9th or 10th grade. When a girl has grown out of their section, they are graduated and moves on to the next section. This process is called the bridigin ceremony, and is held every end of the year.</p>
